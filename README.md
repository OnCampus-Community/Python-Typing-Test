## Typing Test Application proudly made with Python

This is a Python program made with Tkinter, a default GUI library in Python. It is a typing test application that allows users to test their typing speed and accuracy. The program displays a random paragraph and the user must type it out as quickly and accurately as possible. It uses a timer that counts down from 60 seconds, after which the user can see their words per minute (WPM) speed and accuracy.
